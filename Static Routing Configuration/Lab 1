Routing operation in network is achieved either with static configuration or routing protocol (ex: OSPF). Static Configuration
is manually adding routes to routing table using IP route command. Adding routes in real network requires full knowledge of 
networks available in environment to avoid human errors. Static configuration has advantages over protocols in that it is 
less time consuming (no need to wait for protocol retrieve route), and better performance since CPU, processor and memory 
are not allocated any resource to protocol(s) up and running. The known disadvantage is it is prone to human error example 
missing a route, which is avoided using routing protocols.
