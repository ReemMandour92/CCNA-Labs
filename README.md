# CCNA-Labs
CCNA Labs with Cisco Packet Tracer
The repository is a collection of self-study CCNA labs I thought of and practiced during my study to achieve CCNA certification. These are beginner friendly practice labs that helped me practically get full picture of crucial concepts 
in networking that were hard to grasp theoritically. I hope anyone viewing will find great value from them.
